                    <h3>Introduction</h3>       
                     <p>Hi there! I'm Ayeni Solomon Damilola — a curious mind at the intersection of creativity and technology.</p>
                     <p>I'm a graphic designer turned full-stack developer-in-training,
                     with a deep passion for digital experiences that are both beautiful and functional. 
                     Whether it's designing eye-catching visuals, building responsive websites, or exploring ways to 
                     make content more engaging, I'm all about creating value through thoughtful design and smart tech.</p>
                     <p>Currently enrolled in a full-stack development program, I'm expanding my skills in front-end 
                     and back-end technologies to better bring ideas to life—while staying rooted in clean, 
                     user-focused design principles.</p>
