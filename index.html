        <h3>Who I Am</h3>
        <p>Hi there! I'm Ayeni Solomon Damilola - a curious mind at the intersection of creativity and technology.</p>
        <p>I'm a graphic designer and web designer and currently a full-stack developer-in-training, 
        with a deep passion for digital experiences that are both beautiful and functional. 
        Whether it's designing eye-catching visuals, building responsive websites, 
        or exploring ways to make content more engaging, 
        I'm all about creating value through thoughtful design and smart tech.</p>
        <p>Currently enrolled in a full-stack development program,
         I'm expanding my skills in front-end and back-end technologies to better bring ideas 
         while staying rooted in clean, user-focused design principles.</p>
